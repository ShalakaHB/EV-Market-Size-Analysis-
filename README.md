# EV-Market-Size-Analysis
Market size analysis is a crucial aspect of market research that determines the potential sales volume within a given market. It helps businesses understand the magnitude of demand, assess market saturation levels, and identify growth opportunities.
## Project Overview : 
The Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis project will involve collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to understand the current and projected market size of electric vehicles. The analysis will cover global, regional, and country-specific markets, identifying key trends, growth drivers, and strategic opportunities. The final deliverables will include a detailed report with actionable recommendations and a series of visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Tools and Technologies : 
- Python: For data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly: For creating visualizations.
-  Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive data analysis and reporting.

## Dataset Description : 
We will use this dataset for the analysis:  Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv

### EV Population Data: 
- Dataset Name: Electric Vehicle Population Data
- Source: User-uploaded dataset containing detailed information about electric vehicles, including their make, model, year, type, electric range, and location.
- Citation: This dataset is provided by the user and includes data on various attributes of electric vehicles, such as VIN, county, city, state, postal code, model year, make, model, electric vehicle type, clean alternative fuel vehicle eligibility, electric range, base MSRP, legislative district, DOL vehicle ID, vehicle location, electric utility, and 2020 census tract.

### Problem statements : 
1. Define whether the analysis is global, regional, or focused on specific countries.
2. Gather information from industry associations, market research firms (e.g., BloombergNEF, IEA), and government publications relevant to the EV market.
3. Use historical data to identify trends in EV sales, production, and market.
4. Analyze the market size and growth rates for different EV segments.
5. Based on the market size analysis, provide strategic recommendations for businesses looking to enter or expand in the EV market.
